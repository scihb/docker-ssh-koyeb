# docker-ssh-koyeb


this repo will show you how you can set ssh inside koyeb to have a little server in koyeb.



frist when you will create a new web instance instead of using docker paste in this link: https://github.com/scihb/docker-ssh-koyeb




then expose port 22 over tcp and its all done!


but the password isint very safe. (1234cool), clone this reo, modify the dockerfile to change the password (where it says root:1234cool) to your and then publish in gihub, the get the link of your repo and instead of mine put yours.
